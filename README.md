## Code Introduction
This repository aims to build and showcase an easier way of approaching machine learning in Python without any hyper tuning.
The library fits the input data to each regression or classifaction model and returns different prediction metrics 
used for comparisson.
This can severely speed up the process of selecting the right machine learning algorithm for different problems and increase the general 
accuracy of predictions.
